# vegetarian-recipes

I avoid as much as I can some ingredients from my diet, and I have found some replacements:
- flour -> corn flour
- pasta -> cabbage & noodles (as they are easier to diggest) & courgette noodles
- rice -> coliflower rice & quinoa
- potato -> cabbage
- cow milk -> oat & nuts milk

## MISCELLANEOUS
