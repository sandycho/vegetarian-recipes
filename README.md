# vegetarian-recipes

I avoid as much as I can some ingredients from my diet, and I have found some replacements:
- flour -> corn flour
- pasta -> cabbage & noodles (as they are easier to diggest) & courgette noodles
- rice -> coliflower rice & quinoa
- potato -> cabbage
- cow milk -> oat & nuts milk

## MISCELLANEOUS

### Peanut butter noodles 🌿🥜

- 6 oz. noodles or cabbage 
- 2 tbsp. pure sesame oil
- 1 1/2 tbsp. peanut butter
- 2 tbsp. honey
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce
- 1 1/2 tbsp. rice vinegar
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- ½ tsp. grated fresh ginger root
- Optional Garnish: 3 sliced green onions and 1 1/2 tsp. sesame seeds

##### Instructions
1. Cook and drain the noodles according to the package directions.
2. In a medium bowl, add the sesame oil, peanut butter, honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger. Whisk until well combined. The peanut butter should completely break down to create a smooth sauce.
3. Pour the sauce over the hot noodles. Toss to coat.
4. Optional: top each serving with 1 sliced green onion and ½ teaspoon of sesame seeds.
